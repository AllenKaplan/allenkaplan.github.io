          I'm a 4th Year Software Engineering student at York University in
          Toronto. I have a deep passion for technology and entrepreneurship
          that grew from the startup accelerator at my school- BEST Lab, where I
          currently am working as a research assistant until April 2021. In my
          free time, I take my passion for technology to conferences,
          competitions and hackathons. I'm passionate about mentorship and
          helping pass on knowledge to peers.
