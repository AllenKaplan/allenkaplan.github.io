          I have a deep passion for technology and entrepreneurship that grow
          from the incubator at my school- BEST Lab, where I currently am
          working as a research assistant studying design sprints until the end
          of April 2021
        </li>
        <li>
          In my free time, I attend many conferences, competitions and
          hackathonsâ€”one of things I miss most about in person events
        </li>
        <li>
          Between my school community and the technology community, I really
          care about mentorship and helping pass on what I know to my peers so
          they can mentor others themselves
        </li>
        <li>
          Beyond that, I also really enjoy the outdoors and I love to hike, camp
